# Grazioso Salvare Dashboard

## Project Overview

Grazioso Salvare is a company with a noble mission: to rescue animals and train them for search-and-rescue operations, which can be vital in disaster scenarios, search missions, and in providing support to emergency response teams. The Grazioso Salvare Dashboard is at the heart of this mission, serving as a pivotal tool for the organization's operational efficiency.

Developed as a full-stack application, the dashboard is designed to interface seamlessly with a MongoDB database. Its primary function is to identify, categorize, and maintain a dynamic and accessible database of dogs that are potentially suitable for various specialized types of search-and-rescue training programs. These programs include water rescue, mountain or wilderness rescue, disaster recovery, and scent tracking. 

The dashboard not only helps in filtering and visualizing dog profiles according to their suitability for specific rescue profiles but also streamlines the process of training management. By providing an intuitive and interactive user interface, the dashboard significantly reduces the time and effort required to manage the training schedules and profiling of rescue dogs. This efficiency is crucial in ensuring that dogs are trained and deployed in a timely manner, thereby saving lives and providing much-needed support in rescue operations.

The following sections provide detailed instructions on how to set up and utilize the dashboard, ensuring that you can get the system up and running with minimal setup time.
